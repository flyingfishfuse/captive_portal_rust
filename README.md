# captive_portal_rust
Im rewriting the captive portal in Rust, seems like a better language for what I'm trying to do.

captive portal based in /*c++*/ RUST with an ncurses based command line functionality consisting of several options allowing for implementation of the Beef Framework and Bettercap in your attack... or even legal use, this is going to have an actual (hopefully)  secure authentication implementation using hashing and maybe other methods

I want to make this work on windows but that is definetely going to happen AFTER I finish way more of this... maybe with rust I don't have to try and it will just turn out that way?

I'm NOT going ot be done with this for a long time but I'm going to make this my primary project... it has enough different parts I can jump around to keep from burning out on any one single part. Its also neato and useful and I haven't seen what I'm trying to do except for fluxion and its older and doesn't do what Im planning.
  
The idea of this tool is that it presents a captive portal setup to the network of your choice. You can either choose to make this YOUR network or SOMEONE ELSE'S (illegal without permission) 
  
If you choose to use someone elses network,  I give you a few choices how.
 
I also give you the option to beefhook every host that gets caught in the attack
  
TODOTOFU:
  - How can I make a TODO if I havent even ported over all the code yet?
