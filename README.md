# captive_portal_rust
Im rewriting the captive portal in Rust, seems like a better language for what I'm trying to do.

captive portal based in /*c++*/ RUST with an ncurses based command line functionality consisting of several options allowing for implementation of the Beef Framework and Bettercap in your attack... or even legal use, this is going to have an actual (hopefully)  secure authentication implementation using hashing and maybe other methods.

I'm going to use the distro_maker script to create a safe sandbox in the case of a l337_haxX0r trying to play games with the portal. SANDBOX SCRIPT ALMOST DONE! YAY!

I'm NOT going ot be done with this for a long time but I'm going to make this my primary project... it has enough different parts I can jump around to keep from burning out on any one single part. Its also neato and useful and I haven't seen what I'm trying to do except for fluxion and its older and doesn't do what Im planning.
 
The idea of this tool is that it presents a captive portal setup to the network of your choice. You can either choose to make this YOUR network or SOMEONE ELSE'S (illegal without permission) 
  
If you choose to use someone elses network,  I give you a few choices how.
 
I also give you the option to beefhook every host that gets caught in the attack if its via a browser vector.


TODOTOFU:
  - How can I make a TODO if I havent even ported over all the code yet?
  - Dont mention the glaringly obvious errors and syntax fuxkups please, I know whats wrong and what needs to be done, you arent in my head reading my thoughts. I'm learning a new language by translating my code, yeah its gonna have some confusion in it. "just because it looks wrong doesnt mean its going to BE wrong"

License: I don't care what any other license on any of my other software says, THIS project folder is NOT for redistribution ... not just yet. If you want to use some of my code, you must ask me in discord... If you dont know what Discord server I am on, you should assume that means you cant use it. 

The distromaker is going to be finished soonish
